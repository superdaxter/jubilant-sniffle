This is a React port of my Urban Flavor New Tab page.
The static site can be found here: https://superdaxter.github.io/urban_flavor/
The port is currently being developed and can be found at my website here: https://supasnipa.xyz/

The purpose of this project is to learn React/Node.

Data for the App is stored in an xlsx file. This is then converted to JSON with a python script. From there, the data is read in and the front-end is generated.
